## GIN-Ship-type  
A Graph Representation Learning Approach for Imbalanced Ship Type Recognition Using AIS Trajectory Data
## Description
* Data preparation  
Data preparation phase, which contains AIS data mapping, data cleaning, feature extraction, and trajectory map construction.  
* Ship type identification  
Ship type identification model  
* data  
Upload the data to the data folder with the data folder name "xxx";  
Store the prepared data in the "raw" folder;  
The data in the repository is used only as a display of where the data files are stored (the data folder is on the same level as the Ship type identification folder);  
Description of model input data (raw folder): https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/format/  
The "processed" folder and internal data files are generated by the code.
